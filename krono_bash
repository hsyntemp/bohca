If you are looking for a way to display the length of time your script ran, the following will provide a (not completely accurate) result:

As near the beginning of your script as you can, enter the following

basetime=$(date +%s%N)

This'll give you a starting value of something like 1361802943996000000

At the end of your script, use the following

echo "runtime: $(echo "scale=3;($(date +%s%N) - ${basetime})/(1*10^09)" | bc) seconds"

which will display something like

runtime: 12.383 seconds
